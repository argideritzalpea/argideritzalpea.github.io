I am currently a PhD student at UW Linguistics working with the [CLMBR group](https://clmbr.shane.st/). My professional experience working as an applied NLP data scientist / engineer spans several years at [USAA](https://www.usaa.com/) at the Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning team and [mosaix.ai](https://www.mosaix.ai/), a semantic search and voice assistant startup. I formerly worked as an Economics Fellow researching spatio-temporal accounting of ecosystem services with the U.S. Forest Service' Research and Development branch after obtaining an M.P.P from the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy at the University of Virginia.
