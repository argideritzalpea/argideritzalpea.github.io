# About

*Status: Currently seeking opportunities for Fall 2018*

I am currently a Data Science for Social Good Fellow at the eScience Institute at the University of Washington, where I am working with a team to build an object detection model to identify degrees of monetary damages from post-disaster satellite imagery. I am also completing  an M.S. in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington and writing a thesis on toponym resolution in unstructured text. I hope to address social science questions by building systems that translate spatial language into meaningful representations.

Prior to studying linguistics and machine learning at the University of Washington, I obtained an M.P.P. from the University of Virginia where I gained experience in econometrics and statistical analysis as applied to (environmental) policy problems. I then served as an Economics Fellow with the U.S. Forest Service' Research and Development branch, where I worked on geospatially-explicit economic modelling.
