I am currently an NLP Data Scientist at USAA building systems for information extraction, ontologization, and causal analytics. Previously, I was an NLP Engineer at [mosaix.ai](https://www.mosaix.ai/), a semantic search and voice assistant startup.

Prior to graduating from the University of Washington with an M.S. in Computational Linguistics, I obtained an M.P.P. from the University of Virginia and served as an Economics Fellow with the U.S. Forest Service' Research and Development branch.
