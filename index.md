I am currently an NLP Data Scientist at USAA building systems for information extraction, grammar induction, corpus analytics, and speech recognition. I am currently developing models to induce explainable and unsupervised ontologies of text corpora for intelligible, discrete concept featurization of domains. 
Previously, I was an NLP Engineer at [mosaix.ai](https://www.mosaix.ai/), a semantic search and voice assistant startup.

Prior to graduating from the University of Washington with an M.S. in Computational Linguistics, I obtained an M.P.P. from the University of Virginia and served as an Economics Fellow researching spatio-temporal accounting of ecosystem services with the U.S. Forest Service' Research and Development branch.
