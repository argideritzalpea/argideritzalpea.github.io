I am currently am currently an NLP Engineering Intern with mosaix.ai in Palo Alto as I complete an M.S. in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington. I am broadly interested in addressing social science questions by building systems that translate spatial language into meaningful semantic representations.

Prior to studying computation linguistics at the University of Washington, I obtained an M.P.P. from the University of Virginia and served as an Economics Fellow with the U.S. Forest Service' Research and Development branch, where I worked on geospatially-explicit economic modelling.
