I am an NLP Engineer at [mosaix.ai](https://www.mosaix.ai/) and a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Washington working on the [LORELEI project](https://www.darpa.mil/program/low-resource-languages-for-emergent-incidents). I am broadly interested in building systems that address social science questions by querying meaningful semantic representations.

Prior to studying computation linguistics at the University of Washington, I obtained an M.P.P. from the University of Virginia and served as an Economics Fellow with the U.S. Forest Service' Research and Development branch, where I worked on geospatially-explicit economic modelling.
